      <p>
        I'm a developer passionate about creating robust and efficient software. Although my main specialization is in 
        <strong>C and C++</strong>, I also have experience with other languages and technologies such as 
        <strong>Python, JavaScript, and React</strong>, which allows me to adapt easily to different environments and technical requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a strong focus on systems programming, data structures, and algorithms, as well as writing optimized, high-performance code. 
        I enjoy tackling complex technical challenges and exploring new techniques that enhance software quality and efficiency.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm looking for opportunities to apply my skills in real projects and collaborate with development teams where I can continue growing professionally.
